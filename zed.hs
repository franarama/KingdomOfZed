   Kingdom of Zed

   The additional functionality I have completed is:
      - 1. Allow maps of Zed or arbitrary size, i.e. any nÃ—n map for n >= 2.
      - 2. Allow incomplete information. For this option, merchants may withold information from
           you. If they do, their clue is represented as a 0 (zero).

   The additional functionality is noted in the comments above the appropriate
   function, with a **.

   Note this solution uses no intelligent solving which means it can be
   slow for larger map sizes.
